<h1 align="center">👋🏻😊 Hi there, I'm Mahsa Ghezel</h1>

![me](/assets/me.jpg)

I’m a front-end developer passionate about creating beautiful and interactive websites. I’m skilled in JavaScript, React.js, TypeScript, and HTML5/CSS3, and I love using tools like React-Redux, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to build responsive, user-friendly applications.

While I’m focused on front-end development right now, I’m also familiar with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), Vue.js, and Docker. I'm always learning new technologies to expand my skill set. I enjoy collaborating with other developers and using Git and GitHub to manage and contribute to projects efficiently.
